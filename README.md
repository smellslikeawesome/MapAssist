# This branch


This branch serves the customized ItemFilter.yaml config file only. Please note that while we aim to not be spammy, there are some items for which this is unavoidable.

As an example: Items like Druid pelts which have automatic + to random class skills are valuable both in gold terms for vendoring, and in terms of 3x +3 skills modifiers being valuable to players. So we log Druid pelts in Normal, Exceptional, and Elite Varieties. These can also come with or without sockets, which means that they are valuable for runewords as well. Druid pelts with no sockets can have sockets added by Larzuk or via the cube, so this config logs 0 socket druid pelts in addition to 2 and 3 socket pelts. Unfortunately, sometimes pelts can spawn as a white item with no automatic +skills at all, and with no sockets. This makes those specific pelts worthless, however I believe this extra noise from these drops is worthwhile due to the high value of say a 0 socket pelt with 3x +3 skills for endgame usage once socketed by Larzuk and a runeword is added.
