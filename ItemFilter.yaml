# Item filter rules
# "Any" can be used if you would like to see ALL uniques, all set items, all items with x sockets, etc
# Most of the time we don't want to filter that broadly, so this is commented out with #
#Any:
#  - Qualities: crafted

# The first line or "Key" is the item base type, in the next case, "Harlequin Crest" is a unique "Shako"
# Alert to any unique Shako, regardless of any other criteria (sockets, eth)
Shako:                              # Item Base Type
  - Qualities: unique               # Rule starts with "-" and lists one of 3 criteria
  - Qualities: [inferior, normal, superior]
    Sockets: [0, 2, 3]

# Additional criteria can be listed below the first. Do not prefix a "-" to lines with criteria you wish to include
# as part of the same rule. You can also list multiple values for both Qualities and Sockets as shown in the Thresher
# example below
#
# This thresher rule is really 2 separate rules. One with 3 criteria and one with a single criteria.
# The first rule will look for only ethereal threshers with 0 or 4 sockets that are either normal or superior quality
# The second rule looks only for unique threshers. The criteria listed for the first rule do not apply to the second
# Therefore, the second rule will log any unique thresher, with any number of sockets
Thresher:
  - Ethereal: true
    Qualities: [normal, superior]
    Sockets: [0, 4]
  - Qualities: unique # The Reaper's Toll

# Criteria are: Ethereal (true/false), Sockets (0-6), and Qualities
# Qualities is one of the item quality levels. Item qualities start at inferior for low quality/cracked/etc items,
# and move from there to normal, superior, magic, set, rare, unique, and crafted
#
# Another way to list multiple values for Qualities and Sockets is to list each desired quality or number of sockets
# on its own line with an extra indent and a "-"
# This format is supported but its use is discouraged
# This mage plate rule will look for any normal/superior mage plate with 0 or 3 sockets
# Because Ethereal: true is not set here, both non-ethereal and ethereal items will trigger this rule
Mage Plate:
  - Qualities:
    - normal
    - superior
    Sockets: [0, 3]
  - Qualities: unique # Que-Hegan's Wisdom

# This will show unique monarchs as well as non-magical monarchs with 0 or 4 sockets
Monarch:
  - Qualities: unique # Stormshield
  - Qualities: [normal, superior]
    Sockets: [0, 3, 4]

# This is just an object that holds all our commonly used aliases
# Aliases are labeled by the `&` and then the name and provide a simple way to reuse rule criteria later on
# They are used by referencing `*` then the name as you'll see in the Mercenary section of this config
